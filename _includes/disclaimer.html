<p class="mb-5">Although it may look similar, this site is not to be confused with nzdsos.com - a website created by the anti-vaccine, anti-science group Voices for Freedom. Their website hosts a dangerous declaration that has been signed by a few doctors, some of whom appear to have fallen down a conspiracy rabbit hole or two. This website has been created by the NZ Skeptics to highlight just how few doctors have chosen to take an anti-vaccine stance here in New Zealand.</p>
