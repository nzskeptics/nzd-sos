<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Yes, this website looks bad. That's because it's a copy of the Voices for Freedom site, nzdsos.com, which attempts to sow doubt about the COVID vaccine with an open letter signed by 56 doctors. However, unlike the Voices for Freedom website, this one doesn't spread misinformation, doesn't try to scare people, and isn't going to blast you with requests for money or push you to purchase our branded T-shirts and tote bags.</p>
<p>Instead, we've filtered the list of over six and a half thousand doctors who have signed a letter in support of vaccination, and found the most popular names - names where more doctors with that name have signed the letter, than all of the doctors who have signed the NZDSOS anti-vaccine declaration. The links on this site all point to reputable sources of information, and of course the credit for putting together the list of doctors goes to the amazing Doctors Stand Up For Vaccination group.</p>
<p>This site was inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Steve" target="_blank">Project Steve</a>, an effort in the US in the early 2000s to counter a list of creationist scientists (who believe that god, not evolution, created life). The National Center for Science Education countered the creationist list by creating their own list of scientists called Steve who supported evolution, and their list far outnumbered the original creationist list.</p>
<p>The following letter was written and began to be circulated to the doctors of Aotearoa New Zealand to be signed to show support of vaccination against COVID-19. The letter was published with 6535 signatures verified against the medical register and published in <a href="https://interactives.stuff.co.nz/2021/10/doctors-for-covid-vaccination/" target="_blank">Stuff</a> on Super Saturday.</p>
<p>The group will keep the list updated weekly. The letter is accompanied by a <a href="https://www.doctors-stand-up-for-vaccination.com/about-us/" target="_blank">Frequently Asked Questions</a> document that helps answer commonly asked questions about the vaccination. You can find the FAQ document <a href="https://www.doctors-stand-up-for-vaccination.com/about-us/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
